# VE-Sun-Small-Blueish

![Example Screenshot](Mod/thumb.png)

This only modifies sun rays and flares.

You can customize your skybox with my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1380376642] VE Collection [/url].
It includes Skybox, Sun and Environment as seperate mods. They can be combined so that you can build your Skybox to your liking.

It is almost the same sun i use in my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3223582159] VE - Preset Blue[/url] mod.
